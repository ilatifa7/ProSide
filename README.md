# Drug Interaction Knowledge Graph Neural Network 🧬

In today's era of medicine, the complex web of interactions between medications and their effects is at the forefront of research. We delve deep into these interactions, utilizing graph-based learning to decipher drug-drug relations, associated side effects, and indications.

## 🌟 Paradigm Shift in Modern Medicine

Traditionally, the focus has been primarily on the negative implications of drugs. We, however, are pioneering a shift towards proactive research, targeting not just the mitigation of adverse effects but also capitalizing on the potential positive outcomes. This proactive approach leverages the vast medical data to drive improved therapeutic outcomes, emphasizing both unplanned discoveries and the power of predictive modeling.

## 🌐 Core Areas of Focus

1. **Drug-Drug Interactions (DDI)**: Understanding how medications interact when combined is crucial. It affects their efficacy, leading to possible changed therapeutic outcomes or unexpected side effects.
   
2. **Drug-Indications**: This aspect illuminates the conditions a drug is tailored for, highlighting its clinical value.
   
3. **Drug-Side Effects**: Recognizing and predicting potential adverse reactions is key to patient safety.

## 🚀 Advancements in the Field

With machine learning evolving at an unprecedented pace, there have been revolutionary developments in DDI research. Recent studies have highlighted the unpredicted benefits of drugs outside of their primary purpose. Additionally, the domain of drug side effect prediction is witnessing significant advancements. Groundbreaking methods have surfaced that delve into the depths of multi-label side effect predictions, paving the way for accurate forecasts.

## 🎯 Project's Aim

Our central mission is to:

- Craft a **Knowledge Graph Neural Network** that visually represents drug-drug interactions.
- Predict and understand complex relationships linked with beneficial drug side effects.
- Discover novel uses for established drugs, expanding their potential through drug repurposing.

Our primary endeavor is to automate the database search, spotlighting positive side effects arising from drug combinations. Notably, ours is a pioneering solution in this sphere.


## 💡 Methodologies Employed

We rely on robust data analysis tools, blending machine learning with data mining, enabling us to unravel hidden relationships and patterns within extensive datasets. This approach aids in identifying positive side effects that might escape traditional methods.
